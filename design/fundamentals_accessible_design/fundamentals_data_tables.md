# Data Tables

## What is a data table?
- Organized data with logical relationships using grids
- Name/value pairs
- Blind users cannot see the visual association of data
- Users w cognitive disabilities may have trouble interpreting the data

## Techniques
- Need title (<caption>)
- Visually distinct and semantic row and column headers (<th>)
- Summarize data in preceding text
- For users w cognitive disabilities, chart or graph in addition is a good technique
- Never nest them!!
- Don't get TOO fancy/complex
- Careful with things like merging cells
- Markup must be semantic
- Be careful with frameworks. Sometimes they do weird things with the markup
- Scope attributes (col/row)
