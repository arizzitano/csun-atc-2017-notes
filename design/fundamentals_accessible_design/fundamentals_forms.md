# Forms

## Why Important?
- Can be dangerous when:
    - labels/instructions aren't clear
    - error messages are hard to find
    - can't review information before submitting/automatic submission

## Labels
- Must be close to field, descriptive, and visible all the time
- Labels don't need to be SUPER descriptive
- Clarity of label depends who's filling out the form
- Placeholders are bad! Don't use them. Not necessary
- Do user research and usability testing!
- Must keep alert messages in close proximity to fields also
- Label for combo box SHOULD NOT go inside combo box

## Group Labels
- Use for radio buttons, SSN, phone numbers, etc
- Group segmented information or related fields
- MUST LABEL EVERYTHING, super frustrating for SR users when there's no label

## Required Fields
- Asterisks
- Part of the label
- High level message
- Error message (not recommended)
- Could also mark optional fields
- Don't need to do both optional and required, but be consistent
- Define symbols/icons or provide alt text

## Help
- Use when label is not enough
- Better to have short label and longer help text than long label
- Depends on user and field
- Need to programmatically associate help text with fields!
- Should not have to rely on order -- should be focusable at same time as
- Designers: annotate associations
- If pattern/component library, make it part of the code!

## Error messages
- Last line of defense, only if invalid submission occurs. Should be hard to get to
- Error state should be obvious
- Should give user all this information BEFORE submission if possible
- Again, must be programmatically associated

## Review Before Submission
- WCAG requirement
- Financial transaction, legal commitment, **end student test or exam**
- Can't easily recover from some mistakes!

## Pattern libraries
- They make all this super easy!
- Placement of labels, help text, error messages, etc
- Instructions on each piece of data
- Programmatic associations, if possible
