# Navigation

## Important
- Elements must be clear and consistent
- Users need to be able to find what they're looking for
- Don't OOM the user

## Navigational elements
- Menus, sidebars, buttons, lists of links
- Things that help take you to another place
- Not: headings or landmarks
- Open question: mobile/desktop menu continuity
- "Navigational vegetarian" -- someone who hates hamburger menu :)
- "Menu" text maybe better than hamburger menu
- Ease of access most important

## Consistency
- Consistency b/w icons
- Consistency b/w language
- SHOULD NOT BE CONTEXT DEPENDENT
- Labels should make sense in isolation

## Order
- Most important items first
- Users need to be able to recognize existing patterns
- Important for keyboard navigation
- Users only have so much memory

## Multiple Means
- Keyboard/SR users need multiple means to access same content
- Global search
- Sitemap
- Table of contents
- Links to related pages (e.g. news sites)
- All pages linked from homepage (only makes sense for small sites)

## Link text
- No "click here" or "here"
- Describe what it is and where it's going
- Better CTA
- Helps you know where exactly you're going
- Better for SEO
