# Sonification for Accessibility of Data Tables in Science Assessments

Educational Testing Service - 3/3/2017

## Challenges
- Ben Shneiderman, 1996: overview, zooming, filtering
- screen readers inadequate for overviews

## Progress
- Ti84/orbit graphing calculator
- software based audio graphing tools
- accessible scientific instruments
- Research proves utility of sonification

## ETS
- sonic tables
- static for negative

## Web Based Sonification Tool
- enable it in context of realistic science assessment
- gather initial usability data with screen reader users
- tested with middle school science class

## Design of tool
- JS for inclusion in web pages
- can be used readily anywhere
- extracts data columns directly from table
- Web Audio API
- UI of tool designed for SR accessibility

## Session procedure
- bg interview
- observe participant interacting with at least one task without and one task with
- avg 2 with tool, 1 without
- identify usability problems and ask to evaluate severity
- interview about usability of sonification tool and task as a whole
- 75 mins each

## Data analysis
- tool related usability issues
- identify themes among usability problems
- tabulate results
- 5/7 participants thought it was easy to use
- 6/7 easy to learn to use
- majority of participants found it at least somewhat usable
- one user was sighted
- difficulty finding, entering, and exiting

## Need?
